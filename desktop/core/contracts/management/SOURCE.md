# Where this contract comes from

These six files are the engine's management contract, copied byte for byte:

| file here | engine path |
|---|---|
| `PROTOCOL.md` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/PROTOCOL.md` |
| `protocol.schema.json` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/protocol.schema.json` |
| `fixtures/requests.jsonl` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/fixtures/requests.jsonl` |
| `fixtures/success.jsonl` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/fixtures/success.jsonl` |
| `fixtures/errors.jsonl` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/fixtures/errors.jsonl` |
| `fixtures/compatibility.jsonl` | `apps/fermix_core/priv/management/fixtures/compatibility.jsonl` |

- Repository: fermix (the engine)
- Commit: `6ba34da77f649722e8bc0f450aa7449743772766` (2026-10-10, "fix(mobile): a phone is given
  only the addresses Fermix answers on, and the announcement ships off"), the last commit to touch
  `priv/management`
- Protocol version: 2, daemon window 1..2.
- `CHECKSUMS.txt` holds the SHA-256 of each file, in `sha256sum` format.

Never edit these files by hand. To take a new engine contract, copy the six files again from a
committed engine, rewrite `CHECKSUMS.txt` with `sha256sum PROTOCOL.md protocol.schema.json
fixtures/requests.jsonl fixtures/success.jsonl fixtures/errors.jsonl fixtures/compatibility.jsonl`,
update the commit above, and run `cargo test -p fermix-client`: the golden fixtures then say whether
the app still decodes what the daemon sends.
